# FriendContact

Another react project for the C# academy.
It can be found here https://www.thecsharpacademy.com/project/38

### 

This time i didn't try to test things, i focused more on trying to get used to Tailwind. The project itself was fine but Redux took a bit for me to get used to, given the fact that while their documentantion is fine, they have 2 tutorial tracks with some duplicate information. Overall i enjoyed using it but i'll probably have to revisit it a few times to really "get" it.

As for the backend, nothing new.

### start the backend

CLone the project and start the solution

### start the frontend
clone the project and inside the friend-list-front folder, type npm-start
